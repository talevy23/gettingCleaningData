Feature Selection 
=================

The features were selected according to the instructions in Cleaning Data Course Project.
Features with prefix 'time' are time variables.
Features with prefix 'frequency' are frequency variables.
A postfix of X,Y or Z corresponds to the axis of the measure.
All features are either 'Mean' or 'Std'.

Group Keys
=================
The mean value was calculated by grouping on the following columns
- labels
- subjects

Total subjects: 30
Available labels:
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING
